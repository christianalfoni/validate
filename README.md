validate
========

A general JavaScript validation tool with pre-configuration, Backbone support and can be used cross client/server

Contribute
==========
To contribute to the project you can add new validators. I did not add the possiblity to add validators in the API 
because I want them all to be available to everyone. So if you want to use this small plugin, please add your 
new validators to this GIT project.

### Adding a new validator
This is the required validator.
  ´´´javascript
    var wazup = "string";
